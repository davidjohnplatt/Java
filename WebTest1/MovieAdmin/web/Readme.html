<p><B>Movie Administration</B> is an example that demonstrates how to 
use virtual forms, ObjectListDataProvider, and RequestBean in Visual Web Pack.  
</p>
<p>
The Movie Administration example is a hypothetical administrative application for a movie rental business. 
The business maintains data about its movie collection in a data store, and the administrative application enables 
employees to make changes to that data. The business also has a separate external web site that enables customers 
to browse the collection. The same data store is used for the external web site.</p>
<p>
An employee using the application can view the movies in a particular genre by making a selection in 
the <B>Current Genre</B> dropdown list. The <B>Movies</B> table shows the movies in the current genre.
Within the Movies table, the title, year, 
length in minutes, rating, image URL, and description fields can be edited; the 
changes are saved when the employee clicks the <B>Update</B> button or uses the 
table's paging controls (when available). The employee can remove a movie from 
the collection by clicking the <B>Remove</B> button in one of the rows. Clicking 
the <B>Preview</B> button in one of the rows navigates to 
<CODE>Preview.jsp</CODE>, which enables the employee to preview the detail page 
for a movie as it would be seen by a customer browsing the external web site. (<CODE>Preview.jsp</CODE> 
also enables the employee to change the genre of the movie being previewed.) A 
separate set of controls appears below the table for adding a movie to the 
collection.</P>
